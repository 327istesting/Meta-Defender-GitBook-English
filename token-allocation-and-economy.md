Is "Mining Output" DeFi's liquidity mining?

Traditional Liquidity Mining is an effective means for decentralized projects to give back to the community, but beyond that, Meta Defender wants to explore more types of mining that fit with the insurance scenarios. Possible scenarios are sToken holder mining, policyholder mining, and even mining for some off-chain scenarios that have access to the Meta Defender protocol. It will be an exciting story to look forward to.

What is "Treasury Retention"?

Polkadot and the whole web3 world are still developing rapidly, just as the insurance industry has not yet fully exploded, and unprecedented changes can happen in this market at any time. The Treasury Retention Token is a reserve of funds to adapt to new changes in the future, and it will be prepared for project upgrades, participation in public chains, and introduction of strategic partners. The Treasury Retention will be locked for a long time until it is clearly applied.
