# Meta Defender's Coverage

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** The content listed in this document is subject to change as the project's decentralized governance progresses.
{% endhint %}

## **Basic Coverage**

Meta Defender's website lists a whitelist of covered items, which currently includes specific protocol, public chain security, data or privacy security hosted on the public chain, and traffic-based security matters.&#x20;

Asset price hedging is not covered, and Meta Defender's algorithm is fundamentally different from the options platforms.

## **Coverage Governance**

The whitelist of coverage is dynamic. A decentralized project governance committee can add/suspend a covered project by voting. Endorsers of new projects are obligated to provide initial liquidity to the new project.
